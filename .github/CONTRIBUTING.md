# Contributing

## Purpose
Keep changes calm, readable, and aligned with government/regulatory expectations.

## Before you change anything
- Read `.github/PRODUCT_SPECS.md` and follow it exactly.
- Do not add features or copy that are not in the specs.

## Style expectations
- Keep code minimal and easy to understand.
- Add clear comments that explain intent (like you are teaching a 10-year-old).
- Favor accessibility, safety, and auditability.

## PR checklist
- Copy matches `.github/PRODUCT_SPECS.md`
- No unused files
- `npm run typecheck` passes
